## My first repository
Hello, i am Guilherme Teixeira, i've 26 years old, living in Brazil.
 Since when i was a child, the technology it was a big part of my life.
 Counter-Strike 1.6 was one of my favorite games, finding out one way to be a best player to distributing HS for anemies. After that, i found a MMORPG that i passed all night awake playing until the morning, it called Ragnarok! 
 I was just a small kid that played games in PC and consoles video game like PS1/2 and Xbox generations.
 It was never my goal to work with it. But today, i can see now, that's the only thing which i like it and nowadays i want to get start a technology career. I would like to know where to begin to get my first job, and to build some projects on GitHub is my thinking to it start.
